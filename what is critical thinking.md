# What is critical thinking?

Critical thinking is utilizing logic but also keeping an open mind to the possibilities. The ability to keep multiple potential models of reality in your toolset that can be used when they are pragmatic as it is impossible to know everything and no model or concept of reality is perfect. Use disconfirming evidence.

Critical thinking is a way of making "objective" descisions via deconstruction. Critical thinking is about meta-cognition and thinking about thinking to reach unbiased conclusions. Apply some standards to that thinking. 

Critical thinking help keeps you out of group think.

Seperate the idea from the person. Anyone can have a good idea and recognizing that can help with critical thinking. 


### The Critical Society

>The critical habit of thought, if usual in society, will pervade all its mores, because it is a way of taking up the problems of life. Men educated in it cannot be stampeded by stump orators ... They are slow to believe. They can hold things as possible or probable in all degrees, without certainty and without pain. They can wait for evidence and weigh evidence, uninfluenced by the emphasis or confidence with which assertions are made on one side or the other. They can resist appeals to their dearest prejudices and all kinds of cajolery. Education in the critical faculty is the only education of which it can be truly said that it makes good citizens.

-William Graham Sumner

 To get to the top % of IT industry you don't need to be super talented. Just avoid the top big mistakes. You can be in the top 1% if you understand the tools and methods and how to approach the problem. 
 
 
In a room of 30 or more people there is a more than 50% probability of two people sharing the same birthday.

**The traveling salesmen problem.**

>The travelling salesman problem asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?

In March 2005, the travelling salesman problem of visiting all 33,810 points in a circuit board was solved using Concorde TSP Solver: a tour of length 66,048,945 units was found and it was proven that no shorter tour exists. The computation took approximately 15.7 CPU-years

The problem can be solved heuristically but with less than 100% efficiency with current methods and technology.

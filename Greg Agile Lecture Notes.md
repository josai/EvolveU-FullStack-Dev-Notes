# What is a Concept?

## Concept Formula
* State
* Elaborate -> important, how it works
* Example
* Illustration

A concept is an idea about the state or potential state of the something that can usually be reused in different situations. For example a mechanical engineer and a software engineer are both engineering something and some of the concepts can be reused between them.

## Compare + Contrast

Compare and contrast your ideas between yourself and others and see the differences.

Concepts are like building blocks of thoughts with different sides and connections to things.

Problems can be a black box. █ Try identifying the core concept and peripheral aconcepts. 
Have a meaningful approach, not a mechanical one.


Always use this approach for all concepts. What kind of concepts are operating under this thing?

# AGILE™
Agile™ has become very used as an idea. An entire universe and economy has been built around it. The [Agile manifesto can be found here.](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

Here are the twelve princples in short hand of Agile™
* The highest priority is to stustain a continuous flow of software delivery.
* Change and randomness is not a hinderance, but a benefit.
* Frequent delivery time in small chunks is ideal.
* All parties within the organization must work synergistically in a wholeistic fashion.
* Allow freedom for individuals and teams to self organize. 
* Face to face is the more natural and effective communication approach.
* Functional software is the best yard stick.
* A constant flow of software should be able to be balanced and maintained.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
* Minimalism is key.
* Self organization is the superior form of organization.
* Frequent reflection and adjustment and adaptation.

**A concept is always a good idea until its not.** This way you disable prior bias towards ideas that might be good until there is sufficient disconfirming evidence.

### What problem does Agile™ solve? Why use it?

Agile™ prevents catastrophic fragility and friction of project management that can occur when building incredibly complex projects by making the work enviroment more flexible and nimble.

You have to trust in everyone else in your team in order for Agile™ to work.

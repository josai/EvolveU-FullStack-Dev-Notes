# Introduction to systems - lecture by Greg

**If you just arrived on earth what would be the most important concept to understand?**

The most important concept is change. The nature of reality is constant change and everything is impermenant. There is nothing to cling to that will last. So change shouldn't be avoided but embraced.

Embracing the flowing structure of the universe will liberate you and the current will bring you to great places.

**Forced consensus game results**

* Feeling of hunger
* knowing
* understanding
* order from chaos
* rejection of forced consensus
* open-mindedness

Ask why 5x is that the central concept.

System Example: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization
A DAO runs via voting and reputation systems on a distrubited
ledger such as a blockchain. 

System effect: purtubing complex systems can increase risk and damage, such as with surpressing a fever in an animal with medication causing a sickness to worsen.
